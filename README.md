[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/nogibjj/mjh140_individual4/actions/workflows/cicd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/mjh140_individual4/actions/workflows/cicd.yml)

#### Summary

The objective of this repository is to build a publicly available auto-scaling web application using Flask. The application is containerized into a Docker image and pushed to DockerHub for container storage. The container is then deployed to a public endpoint using Azure Web App.

For this project, I am deploying a Hugging Face Text Generation LLM in a simple application that returns five recommeded books when provided a list of the user's favorite authors.
